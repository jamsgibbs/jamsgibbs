## Full Stack Python Developer with Django, React, and Vue.js Expertise

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building websites and web apps. I mainly work with Python and its frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI for back-end development and use React and Vue.js for front-end development. I also have experience with Artificial Intelligence (AI), in which I can create advanced features like smart recommendations, better search options, and automated tasks, using Machine Learning (ML) and data analysis.

When I work on a project, I do it in small steps. This way, I make sure everything is done on time, and you always know what's going on. I also explain things in a simple way, so you won't get confused by technical terms. I'm ready to jump into your project and make sure it does exactly what you need, in a way that's easy and clear.
